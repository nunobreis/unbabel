# Unbabel frontend challenge - Nuno Reis solution

## 1. Brief Summary
The current project is a proposal for solving the frontend challenge presented by Unbabel. Considering the given problem and purpose of the challenge I decided to follow an Atomic Design Structure (know more about Brad Frost's approach [here](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)).

Following this approach my comoponets are devided in: atoms, molecules and organisms (from the simplest forms to more complex compositions). Then I use templates to define the layout of a view and finally a page that renders the whole composition.

I have created stories through Storybook that render each component in isolation proving that they can stand by themselves and hence be re-used anywhere.

The components handle everything that is presentational. Following Dan Abramov's approach for component composition (presentation components vs logic components) I created containers that don't care about styles/presentation but know about the Redux Store and thus handle all logic within the app.

## 2. Get the project up and running
To get this project up and running in your machine I will assume you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed already.

Just go to the [project repo](https://github.com/nunobreis/unbabel/) and fork the project into your machine.

###Â Install Dependenies

In the project directory install dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

### Run Storybook

To run Storybook server just run the script:

```
npm run storybook
```

If you would like to make a Storybook build just run:
```
npm run storybook-build
```

### Run the project
To run a dev server and see the project use the following script:

```

```

If you want to build the project just use the script:
